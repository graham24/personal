This is the GitHub repository for my personal website, <a href="https://grahamh.dev/">https://grahamh.dev/</a>. 
</p>
<p>
For my personal website, while it is a simple website, I wanted to implement it using React, as that is a framework that I am currently interested in learing and using. I am also connecting to multiple API's, such as GitHub's API, to pull in outside data that is then display using React.
</p>
<p>
I am currently job searching, I am interested mostly in a front-end engineer job, preferably working with React. I am also interested in a full-stack job, as I have experience working with back-end technologies as well, but I prefer to work on the front-end.
