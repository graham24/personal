                I have five years of experience working on multiple full stack development projects.These projects consist of  database design and implementation, creating backend REST services and building front end applications to  connect to and display information from the REST API.Database design and implementation accomplished using  MySQL, phpMyAdmin and MySQL Workbench.REST Services built using a PHP framework.The frontend is a  combination of PHP, JQuery, Javascript, HTML and CSS.Using all these tools I have been able to build and deploy  apps that have managed subscriptions, processed payments and displayed content to the end user.Most of these  projects include building end user interfaces as well as an administrator interface.
